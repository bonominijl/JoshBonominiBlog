I'm a big fan of vertical mice. I find it far more comfortable for longer sessions designing, and I've even become accustomed to it while gaming. I'm no FPS pro but I can still get through my favoritre single player games just fine. 

I decided to combine my love for mechncail keybaords, retro tech, and vertical mice int one package. Thus my idea for the retro vertical mouse was born. The idea is pretty simple, find inspiration from the beige, clunky technology of my childhood, add in hotswap mechanical switches, and make it vertical. 

So far I still only have part of the design, but it's starting to come together.
