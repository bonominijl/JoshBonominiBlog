A collection of songs I use when testing new headphones or audio equipment.
This playlist has been curated over the years and has been influenced by the likes of:
- DankPods

Tracks:
- Scarlet Fire - Otis McDonald
I really enjoy the bass response on this track. The bass is prominent and is useful in evaluating how clear the bass sounds without overpowering other elements.

- A Night Alone - Bobbing, Maddie Jay
This track is great for evaluating the mids and highs. The vocals are clear and distinct, and the music is subtle enough to not overpower the headphones but present enough to evaluate the mids and highs.

- Walk Through the Park - TrackTribe
This track is great for visualizing where different sounds and insturments are coming from. 

- Back in Town - Silent Partner

This track has a lot of small background details that are great for evaluating how well the headphones can pick up on subtle details in the music.
