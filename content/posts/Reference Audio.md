A collection of songs I use when testing new headphones or audio equipment.
This playlist has been curated over the years and has been influenced by the likes of:
- DankPods

Scarlet Fire - Otis McDonald
A Night Alone - Bobbing, Maddie Jay
Walk Through the Park - TrackTribe
Back in Town - Silent Partner
