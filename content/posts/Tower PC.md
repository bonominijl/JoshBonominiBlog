Tower PC design log..

I got into small form factor PCs as, what felt to me at the time as a natural progression of my love for PC building. I soon realized it adds yet another layer of complexity to the build process. It's also really fun trying to figure out the best way to cable manage in tight spaces, picking the exact right GPU that will acutally fit, and finally acecpting that thermals will almsot always suck.

I've tried a few different cases, from the Cougar to the Louque S1. They're all fine in their own right, but I wanted to tack it a step further an design a case myself.

My initial vision for this case is layers of CNC'd walnut, held in place with brass rods running the full length on the case. This would allow for sufficient airflow throughout the case, while adding a somewhat midcentury modern vibe to the asthetic. 

I began looking at existing SFFPC designs and came across the EC1 (Edge case) from the reddit user u/NiceDepth. My design essentially forks theirs, making some structural changes such as using extruded T-bar aluminum more throughout the case such as on each of the 4 corners.
