When your best friend needs a custom 1U rack enclosure for their Ubiquiti 8-port POE switch and raspberry pis, they get a custom enclosure.

Here is the final piece installed in the wall mounted rack. Eventually the Rpis will be used for lab testing and perhaps some home automation workloads.

The piece is printed in two halves and slides together with a somewhat odd dovetail design. 

Future revisions will improve the stability of the cage housing the POE switch. It's very flimsy as is but does gain some rigidity once the swiuth is mounted. I printed this using standard PLA filament and so far thermals have not been an issue and no deformation has been observed after several months of use.
