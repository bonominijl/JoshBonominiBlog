A 1U rack mount model for the Ubiquiti 8-port POE router and up to 2 raspberry pi 4s.

The piece is printed in two halves and slides together with a somewhat odd dovetaiol design. 

Future revisions will improve the stability of the cage housing the POE switch. It's very flimsy as is but does gain some rigidity once the swiuth is mounted. I printed this using standard PLA filament and so far thermals have not been an issue and no deformation has been observed after several months of use.
